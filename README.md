# AmbiTagPlugin
 An ambience system for spawning sounds around actors in unreal

Hello! This plugin is intended to spawn sounds automatically around actors in unreal 5. For an ovreview, please review this video: https://youtu.be/n19OTOB8Qpc

This plugin will be edited to be usable with the base unreal tools, Fmod, and Wwise; but currently it only works with Wwise. 

You can access the debug widget by going to your plugin content in your unreals content browser, right clicking the debug widget (it should look like it has several bars in it's display window) and clicking run in editor. The widget will automatically update in gameplay to show the active information from the system.
